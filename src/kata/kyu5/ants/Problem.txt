Kata Task
My little ants are marching across the terrain from left-to-right in the order A then B then C...

What order do they exit on the right hand side?

Notes
- = solid ground
. = a gap
The number of ants may differ but there are always enough ants to bridge the gaps
The terrain never starts or ends with a gap
Ants cannot pass other ants except by going over ant-bridges
If there is ever ambiguity which ant should move, then the ant at the back moves first

Example
Input
ants = GFEDCBA
terrain = ------------...-----------

Output
result = EDCBAGF
